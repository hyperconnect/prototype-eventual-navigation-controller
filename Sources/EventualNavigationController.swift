///
/// Provides eventual navigation by state sequence.
///
/// You set `queue` as you want, and this object will navigate
/// sequentially through for each state in the queue with animations.
///
/// Switching to another state is done in single animation. For example,
/// if you have 4 view-controllers in navigation-stack and next state has
/// only 1, three view-controllers will be popped out in an animation.
/// You can push three states to the `queue` if you want three-step animations.
///
/// User interaction becomes disabled until all queued states
/// to be consumed.
///
/// You can query current state from this object if needed.
///
/// - Note:
///     UIKit does not support presentation and dismission of multiple
///     modal view-controller at once with animation. It seems to be an
///     intentional design, and I don't want to try to work around this.
///     So this object cannot support presentation of multiple modal
///     VCs in one-step. You are recommended to stack multiple instances of
///     `EventualNavigationController` to present multiple modal VCs.
///
/// - Note:
///     NC allows push/pop while a modal VC is presented.
///
/// - Note:
///     Take care that "0-view-controller in stack" is an abnormal
///     state for an NC, so it won't give you proper animations.
///     Anyway, it still work with no breakage.
